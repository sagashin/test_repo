Profiles of expense risk
Expense risk refers to the risk that the fair value of net assets decreases when actual expenses incurred during business operations exceed those initially projected. This risk is assessed based on the variation in present value resulting from deviations between actual experience and the planned assumptions.

Measuring the risk of expense
A scenario is assumed in which the amount of expenses associated with third-sector products increases by 6% annually due to business-specific factors, in addition to a 1% annual increase attributable to inflation. The present value under this scenario is compared with the present value under the best estimate, and the difference between the two is recognized as the required capital for expense risk.
